    "Inferential Statistics means making conclusion based on data measures.allows you to make predictions (“inferences”) from that data. With inferential statistics, you take data from samples and make generalizations about a population.\n",
    "For inferential statistics, we need to define the population and then devise a sampling plan that produces a representative sample. The statistical results incorporate the uncertainty that is inherent in using a sample to understand an entire population. The sample size becomes a vital characteristic. The law of large numbers states that as the sample size grows, the sample statistics (i.e., sample mean) will converge on the population value.\n",

    "Descriptive and inferential statistics are two broad categories in the field of statistics. In this blog post, I show you how both types of statistics are important for different purposes. Interestingly, some of the statistical measures are similar, but the goals and methodologies are very different.\n",

    "\n",
    "Collectively, this information gives us a pretty good picture of this specific class. There is no uncertainty surrounding these statistics because we gathered the scores for everyone in the class. However, we can’t take these results and extrapolate to a larger population of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics\n",
    "Inferential statistics takes data from a sample and makes inferences about the larger population from which the sample was drawn. Because the goal of inferential statistics is to draw conclusions from a sample and generalize them to a population, we need to have confidence that our sample accurately reflects the population. This requirement affects our process. At a broad level, we must do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the population we are studying.\n",
    "Draw a representative sample from that population.\n",
    "Use analyses that incorporate the sampling error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t get to pick a convenient group. Instead, random sampling allows us to have confidence that the sample represents the population. This process is a primary method for obtaining samples that mirrors the population on average. Random sampling produces statistics, such as the mean, that do not tend to be too high or too low. Using a random sample, we can generalize from the sample to the broader population. Unfortunately, gathering a truly random sample can be a complicated process.\n",

    "For inferential statistics, we can calculate the point estimate for the mean, standard deviation, and proportion for our random sample. However, it is staggeringly improbable that any of these point estimates are exactly correct, and there is no way to know for sure anyway. Because we can’t measure all subjects in this population, there is a margin of error around these statistics. Consequently, I’ll report the confidence intervals for the mean, standard deviation, and the proportion of satisfactory scores (>=70). Here is the CSV data file: Inferential_statistics.\n",

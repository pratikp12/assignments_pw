If two variables have a positive covariance, it means that they tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that they tend to vary in opposite directions. However, the magnitude of covariance depends on the units of the variables, making it difficult to compare covariances between variables that have different units.\n",

    "Correlation, on the other hand, is a standardized measure of the relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, with a value of 1 indicating a perfect positive correlation, a value of -1 indicating a perfect negative correlation, and a value of 0 indicating no correlation. Correlation is obtained by dividing the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables, which makes it unitless and allows for easy comparison between variables.\n",

However, correlation is generally preferred over covariance because it is more interpretable and allows for easier comparisons between different variables.

Since the mean is calculated by taking the sum of all values and dividing by the total number of values, the presence of a single outlier that is significantly larger or smaller than the other values can greatly skew the mean. On the other hand, the median is not affected by extreme values because it is calculated by finding the middle value in a sorted dataset. The mode, which is the most frequently occurring value, is also relatively insensitive to outliers.\n",

    "Example: Consider a dataset of 10 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 100. The mean of this dataset is 15.5, the median is 5.5, and the mode is not applicable since no value appears more than once. The presence of the outlier (100) greatly skews the mean, making it much larger than the median.\n",

    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",

    "Outliers can also have a significant impact on measures of dispersion, such as the range and standard deviation. The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset, and the presence of an outlier can greatly increase the range. The standard deviation, which measures the amount of variation in a dataset, is also sensitive to outliers. In a dataset with outliers, the standard deviation will be larger than in a dataset without outliers.\n",

    "\n",
    "assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear. This means that the predicted values should be a straight line when plotted against the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals should be constant across all values of the independent variables. This means that the error terms should be randomly distributed around the predicted values, with no particular pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Normality: The residuals should be normally distributed. This means that the error terms should be bell-shaped, with most of the values concentrated around the mean and fewer values towards the tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Independence: The residuals should be independent of each other. This means that the error terms should not be correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset. Here are some of the most common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Residual plots: Residual plots are a graphical way to check for linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality. A residual plot shows the residuals (the difference between the predicted values and the actual values) against the independent variables. If the residuals are randomly distributed around the zero line, then the assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity are met. If the residuals are not randomly distributed, then there may be a problem with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Normality tests: There are a number of statistical tests that can be used to check for normality. The most common test is the Shapiro-Wilk test. The Shapiro-Wilk test tests the null hypothesis that the residuals are normally distributed. If the p-value of the Shapiro-Wilk test is less than 0.05, then the null hypothesis is rejected and there is evidence that the residuals are not normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Durbin-Watson test: The Durbin-Watson test tests for autocorrelation in the residuals. Autocorrelation occurs when the residuals are correlated with each other. The Durbin-Watson test has a value between 0 and 4. A value of 2 indicates that there is no autocorrelation. A value less than 2 indicates that there is positive autocorrelation. A value greater than 2 indicates that there is negative autocorrelation.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this scenario:\n",
    "- The slope (10) indicates that for each one-degree increase in temperature, the expected increase in ice cream sales is 10 units. This means that, on average, for every additional degree of temperature, the ice cream sales are expected to increase by 10 units.\n",
    "- The intercept (1000) represents the estimated number of ice cream sales when the temperature is zero. In practice, this value might not have a practical interpretation since it is highly unlikely for the temperature to be exactly zero in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting the slope and intercept in this example:\n",
    "- Slope: The positive slope of 10 suggests that there is a positive relationship between temperature and ice cream sales. It indicates that as the temperature increases, we expect an increase in ice cream sales.\n",
    "- Intercept: The intercept of 1000 represents the estimated number of ice cream sales when the temperature is zero. While this value might not be practically meaningful in this context, it helps define the starting point of the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales.\n",

    "Q8. What are the advantages and disadvantages of polynomial regression compared to linear\n",
    "regression? In what situations would you prefer to use polynomial regression?\n",
    "Advantages of Polynomial Regression:\n",
    "1. Captures non-linear relationships: Polynomial regression can model complex relationships between the independent and dependent variables. It allows for curved and non-linear patterns to be captured, which cannot be achieved by linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Flexibility in fitting data: Polynomial regression can fit a wider range of data patterns compared to linear regression. It can handle data that exhibits polynomial trends or has bends and curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Higher order relationships: Polynomial regression can incorporate higher order polynomial terms (e.g., quadratic or cubic) to capture more nuanced relationships in the data. This flexibility enables the model to better adapt to the data and potentially improve predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Polynomial Regression:\n",
    "1. Overfitting: Polynomial regression with high-order terms can be prone to overfitting, especially when the number of polynomial terms increases. Overfitting occurs when the model fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Complexity and interpretation: As the degree of the polynomial increases, the model becomes more complex and difficult to interpret. Higher-order polynomials can lead to convoluted relationships and make it challenging to extract meaningful insights from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extrapolation issues: Polynomial regression may not perform well when extrapolating beyond the range of the observed data. The model may produce unreliable predictions outside the range of the training data, leading to inaccurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use Polynomial Regression:\n",
    "Polynomial regression is particularly useful in situations where the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is expected to be non-linear or when there is prior knowledge suggesting a specific polynomial relationship. Here are some scenarios where polynomial regression may be preferred:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Curved or non-linear patterns: If the data exhibits a curved or non-linear relationship, polynomial regression can capture these patterns more accurately than linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Polynomial hypotheses: If there is a theoretical or domain-specific reason to believe that the relationship follows a specific polynomial form, using polynomial regression can help incorporate that knowledge into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Improved model fit: When linear regression fails to adequately fit the data and there is evidence of a non-linear relationship, polynomial regression can provide a better fit and potentially improve the model's predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the selection between linear regression and polynomial regression should be based on a careful analysis of the data, consideration of the underlying relationships, and validation of the model's performance.\n",
